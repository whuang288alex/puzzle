# Puzzle

A variation of the popular 8-tile puzzle (https://www.d.umn.edu/~jrichar4/8puz.html).
Given a state of the puzzle, the program can perform the A* search algorithm and print the
path from the current state to the goal state.

This is a part of the CS 540: introduction to artificial intelligence course I took at University of Wisconsin-Madison.
